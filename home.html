    <p>RDK is a carefully designed system of 3D printed
        parts that connect with commonly available 1/2" PVC pipe to support robot design.
         The core question of RDK is simple: how can we make conversations about
        robots more generative and exploratory? RDK is inspired by hands-on computing and robotics educational materials as well as 
        construction kits (i.e. LEGO, K'NEX, Lincoln Logs, etc). 
    </p>
    <p>RDK aims to connect engineering experts and end-users / stakeholders of robotic systems.
        While these two groups often lack a shared familiarity with or language in mechanical engineering and computer science, they both have 
        important and valuable insights to share. RDK creates a shared medium for expressing ideas and building understanding.
        RDK centers the idea that, by strengthening generative collaboration with robot users / stakeholders, we can build 
        a robot future that is more flexible, understanding, and responsive.

    <h2>Robot Development Kit Goals :</h2>
    <ul class="main-list">
        <li>low cost / complexity
        <ul class="sub-list hidden" id="complexity"><li>RDK has no electronics, it's simple and affordable to print</li>
            <li>Materials are cheap and easy to access, built with FDM 3D printing and 1/2" PVC pipe</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>teach stakeholders about robots as they build
            <ul class="sub-list hidden" id="teach"><li>RDK prioritizes open exploration and simplicity, making it fun and easy to start creating robot designs</li>
            <li>RDK encourages users to tinker and hack as they hammer, twist, and tighten parts </li>
        </ul></li>
   
        <li>enable extensibility and customization
        <ul class="sub-list hidden" id="customize"><li>RDK is well documented, open source, and prioritizes components, making it easy to add one part without re-designing everything</li>
            <li>RDK's size pairs well with common ideation materials like pen and paper, so imagining new parts can be as simple as attaching a note</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
