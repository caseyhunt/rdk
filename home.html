    <p>RDK is a carefully designed system of 3D printed
        parts that connect with commonly available 1/2" PVC pipe to support robot design.
         The core question of RDK is simple: how can we make conversations about
        robots more generative and exploratory? RDK is inspired by hands-on computing and robotics educational materials as well as 
        construction kits (i.e. LEGO, K'NEX, Lincoln Logs, etc). By including RDK in robot ideation sessions,
        my hope is that you will uncover unexpected and creative solutions. 
    </p>

    

    

    <p>In particular, RDK seeks to connect engineering experts and end-users / stakeholders of robotic systems.
        While these two groups often lack a shared familiarity or language in mechanical engineering and computer science, they all have vital
        information to share. RDK creates a shared language for expressing ideas and building shared understanding.
        By better understanding robot users / stakeholders and working with them to generate ideas, we can build 
        a robot future that is practical, inclusive, and innovative.

    <h2>Robot Development Kit Goals :</h2>
    <ul class="main-list">
        <li>low cost and complexity
        <ul class="sub-list hidden" id="complexity"><li>RDK is electronic free, so it's simple and affordable</li>
            <li>RDK uses FDM 3D printing and 1/2" PVC pipe, materials are cheap and easy to access</li>
            <li>RDK is designed with open-exploration in mind, no tutorials or curating parts</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>teach stakeholders about robots as they build
            <ul class="sub-list hidden" id="teach"><li>RDK prioritizes open exploration and simplicity, making it fun and easy to start creating robot designs</li>
            <li>RDK provides constraints, designs are closer to build-able prototypes than blue sky ideas</li>
            <li>RDK encourages users to hammer, twist, and tighten parts, asking them to be fabricators instead of spectators</li>
        </ul></li>
   
        <li>enable extensibility and customization
        <ul class="sub-list hidden" id="customize"><li>RDK is a dev kit. It is well documented and open source, simplifying customization and adaptation</li>
            <li>RDK uses componentization, so it is easy to add one part without re-designing everything</li>
            <li>RDK plays well with materials commonly used in ideation sessions, imagining new parts during ideation can be as simple as attaching a sticky-note</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
