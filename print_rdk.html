    <h2>rdk requires a few simple parts</h2>
    <p>Beyond 3D printed pieces, RDK requires a small handful of purchased parts.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2" PVC Pipe and pipe cutters</li>
        <li>M4 heat set inserts, 6mm length</li>
        <li>M4 screws, 3/4" long (hex head recommended)</li>

    <h2>test your printer tolerance</h2>
    <p>For the robot development kit to work well, correct tolerances are very important. Establishing a baseline measurement
        for the tolerance of your 3D printer will make things easier for you. To measure your print tolerance, you can use one of 
        many models provided free online. I've provided a few suggestions below, or you can use the one that you prefer. It is important 
        to test your printer using the parameters that you will use while printing the robot development kit. So, for example, if you 
        want to print the kit at 150% speed, you should also print the tolerance test with that same setting.

    <h2>download your starter pack</h2>
    <p>Once you have an idea of your printer tolerance, you can download one of the zip files below! These files are meant to serve as a starting
        point for printer tolerances that seem common on consumer FDM printers. If your print tolerance is not represented, you can jump to step 4 
        (fine tune your fit). Unfortunately, <span class="bold">there is no guarantee that the parts provided in the .zip file
        work correctly with your printer</span>. Instead, this is meant to be a starting point to make it easier for you.

    <h2>print a test</h2>
    <p> The parts are designed to be printed with the cap using bridging (no supports). While this is not necessary, it makes 
        preparing parts much easier. Whatever you choose, you should repeat the same parameters across the entire kit.
        It is strongly recommended to print a couple of pieces first, especially a coupler and a static connector
        cap. You should check that these have a comfortable amount of grip on a 1/2" PVC pipe, and also interlock with each other tightly. If tests
        go well, then great! You can proceed. If not, you may need to fine tune your fit (step 4).

<div class="steps" id="fine_tune">
    <h1 class="number">4.</h1>
    <h2>fine tune your fit</h2>
    <p>To fine tune your fit, it is recommended to establish two measurements through test prints: the ideal size of caps and the ideal tolerance of 
        the tongue of the tongue and groove connectors. Pick one or two caps to use to test these values before applying these same measurements
        across the kit. Once you know the two measurements work for you, the rest should be easy!

    </ul>

    <h1 class="number">5.</h1>
    <h2>design your own parts</h2>
    <p>After using the kit, I hope that you are inspired to add more parts. Customizing RDK to your own use case allows for
        even more creativity! Creating your own parts is very simple, with the most challenging part being the tongue-and-groove
        design. I include the measurements here for a 0.5 mm tolerance design, so you will need to adjust them to your own fit!
